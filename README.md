**Instruction Set Architecture**

**Done by: Labib Rahman**

**Usage:** 
Download [Logisim](http://cburch.com/logisim/download.html) digital logic simulation tool and run 18bitInstructionRISCProcessor.circ file. Load HEX values for LED matrix display for opcode mnemonic to work. 

**Introduction:**

The CPU designed here is of RISC type and has an instruction width of 18 bits and can perform different arithmetic and logical operations on 32 bit data.

**Assembler:**

The assembler takes assembly language as input which is generated by the compiler of a high-level programming language. This input is then converted into machine language which is in hexadecimal form. This instruction is then fed to the instruction memory in the ROM of our CPU.

**Components used:**

- Logical gates
- Decoders
- Bit extenders
- Adder circuits
- Binary shifters
- Multiplexers
- RAM and ROM
- LED matrix and different wiring for connections

**Operations&#39; Instructions**

**Note:** The assembly language is written with the destination register being specified first but the instruction generated by the assembler and ultimately processed by the CPU, has the destination specified at the last for R type instructions and in the middle for certain I type instructions. To display the mnemonics on the LED matrix, HEX values for the rows must be loaded into the ROM.

**nop:**

# Discussion:

While this CPU can perform a number of operations, few of its limitations and future improvements need to be addressed. For one, we have a very limited number of operations while there is the space for more as we have allocated 6 bits for the opcode. Shift amount and functions fields have been omitted. Few of the basic operations such as multiplication and division do not exist for this processor which can be added in the future. R0 is supposed to be a hardwired constant 0 yet its contents can be changed which is not desirable. More registers and their roles can be added so that they can perform more specialized functions. This is a single cycle data path which performs 1 instruction per cycle. If it were a pipelined architecture multiple instructions could be executed in 1 cycle reducing number of cycles.

**Python code for assembler is included**
